# The Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS) algorithm is a method for estimating multivariate densities.

# In main.py, we use a Gaussian mixture model as an example to demonstrate the performance of VRS. 
# In main.py, the function vrs computes the tensor density estimator, and vrs.predict(new_data) returns the density value at new_data. 

# The folder ''alternative_version'' contains the implementation of VRS based on range estimators.
